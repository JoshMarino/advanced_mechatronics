#### Homework #1 <a name="hw1"></a>
The first homework assignment included wiring the PIC32 with 2 LEDS, 2 push buttons, and a potentiometer. Code had to be written for the following tasks:

1. Toggle LED1 every 1/2 second
2. When USER is pushed, toggle LED1 as fast as possible
3. Set LED2 brightness proportional to the potentiometer voltage
4. Set LED2 frequency to 1kHz using Timer 2 and verify with the nScope or Tek scope


#### Homework #2 <a name="hw2"></a>
Our second homework assignment involved created an EAGLE schematic for our protoboard. New devices had to be created for the following:

1. PIC32MX250F128B (Digikey ED3026-ND)
2. 8MHz resonator (Digikey X905-ND)
3. 2-lead push button (Digikey P8072SCT-ND)

Last, the chips were added to the schematic, and components were connected together with electrical connections.
