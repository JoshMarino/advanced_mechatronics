The first homework assignment included wiring the PIC32 with 2 LEDS, 2 push buttons, and a potentiometer. Code had to be written for the following tasks:

1. Toggle LED1 every 1/2 second
2. When USER is pushed, toggle LED1 as fast as possible
3. Set LED2 brightness proportional to the potentiometer voltage
4. Set LED2 frequency to 1kHz using Timer 2 and verify with the nScope or Tek scope
